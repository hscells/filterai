This is the result of a research project in LISP while on exchange in America. It consists of a feature extraction engine and a painterly rendering engine, which in combination, allow anyone to recreate paintings using their own images or photographs.

There is a [wiki](https://github.com/hscells/filterai/wiki) which explains how to set up and use filterai, and you can even read the paper (when it is finished)
